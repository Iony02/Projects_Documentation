This project was done in highschool at the initiative of a friend (hence why it is not my name in the published article).
My contribution was more on the physical side, designing the components for 3D printing, calculations and dimensioning and crafting the actuators.

There is also a link to YouTube for a [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBl0y2t8s4s)
